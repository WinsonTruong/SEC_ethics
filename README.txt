Context: According to Lubachon Sucharow's SEC's insiders guide:

        "The mission of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC” or “Commission”) is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. An independent federal agency established pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act” or the “’34 Act”), the SEC was designed to enforce the Exchange Act and the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act” or “’33 Act”). In the wake of the Great Depression, these acts were created to restore investor confidence in the capital markets."
